<h1>About The openSUSE Conference </h1>
<p>The openSUSE Conference brings together a wide variety of Open Source contributors to collaborate on one of the major Linux distribution projects.
In four exciting days of workshops and social happenings we bring alive the openSUSE slogan "Have a lot of fun".</p>

<p>This year, the openSUSE conference co-locates with the Czech <a href="http://linuxdays.cz/">LinuxDays event</a>, the SUSE Labs and a <a href="http://gentoo.org">Gentoo minisummit</a>. The openSUSE Conference takes place from October 20-23 whereby we will overlap with LinuxDays on Saturday and Sunday (20 and 21).</p>
