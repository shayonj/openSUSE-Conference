<p>We are happy to announce that after scouting many wonderful places, having long discussions and many last minute changes, we finally have an exact location and date set for the openSUSE Conference 2012 (oSC12) and our CfP committee is ready to accept talk proposals!</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This year oSC12 will take place at the <a href="http://www.cvut.cz/en">Czech Technical University</a> in Prague. The campus is located in the district Dejvice and is next to an underground station that gets you directly to the historic city center. The conference will start at October 20. and end on the 23.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/Location">Location page</a> for more information!</p>

<h2>Co-location and theme</h2>
<p>This years openSUSE Conference theme is <i>"Bootstrapping awesome!"</i>. Why? Not just because of new new city and many new people on the organization part. But also because we are not alone! Yes, like last year, the SUSE Labs conference will join us again but there is more. This year the openSUSE conference will help 'bootstrap' two more conferences who share a location with us. This will be their first year, but we're sure they will turn out to be as awesome as openSUSE Conf is and join us for a lot of fun ;-)</p>

<p>The other two conferences joining us are Gentoo Miniconf and the LinuxDays conference.</p>

<h3>SUSE Labs</h3>

<p>The SUSE Labs Conference was once upon a time a SUSE internal conference that has been organized by SUSE engineers for SUSE engineers for many years. The goal of the meeting was for the technical people to meet once a year and exchange ideas, share their work and learn from each other. The topics for the SUSE Labs Conference tend to be very technical and deep, ranging from Kernel and GCC to networking technology. In 2011, the SUSE Labs conference first joined forces with the openSUSE conference, opening up to external visitors. Like last year, majority of talks by SUSE Labs members will be open for public at oSC 2012.</p>

<h3>LinuxDays Conference</h3>

    <p>LinuxDays Conference is a community effort replacing the well known commercial LinuxExpo conference, which was big event in Czech republic with a long tradition. Unfortunatelly this event died this year as the company running it decided it was no longer worth it. A team of local Free Software enthusiasts decided to pick this up and organize the LinuxDays Conference to ensure a great tradition wouldn't get lost!</p>

    <p>Like LinuxExpo, this event will focus on the Czech speaking Free/Libre Software community and have an emphasis on practical and relatively easy sessions in Czech. The LinuxDays Conference will happen on the weekend of October 20 and 21.</p>

    <p>The openSUSE Conference team is extremely happy to be able to co-locate with LinuxDays! During the weekend we'll work with them on providing beginner- and practical training sessions to the visitors. After all, our aim is to spread the use of Linux everywhere and this is a great opportunity to do so!</p>

<h3>Gentoo Miniconf</h3>

    </div>
    
    <p>The Gentoo Miniconf will be the first incarnation of a global Gentoo gathering. Organized by a few (open)SUSE/Gentoo people in Prague, it will bring together a number of core Gentoo developers to talk about and hack on the future of this geekiest-of-the-geekiest distribution.</p>

    <p>There is a surprisingly large overlap between openSUSE and Gentoo, with a number of prominent openSUSE people using Gentoo as well and vice-versa. Moverover, the university where we'll have the conference is a heavy user of Gentoo, making it an even better location for us. Like with LinuxDays we'll share a number of sessions with the Gentoo crowd and of course will be on the lookout for further collaboration - as always.</p>

<h2>Call for Papers starting</h2>
    <p>From today, the 23th of May onwards, the openSUSE Conference Call for Papers is open. This means you can send in session proposals! The Call for Papers closes on July 30th.</p>

<h3>What kind of proposals do we look for?</h3>
    <p>With respect to our conference theme, we would like to receive proposals for talks, workshops or BoFs which fit with 'bootstrapping' (starting something new). So if you are doing some bootstrapping of your own, representing some very young project and you are just starting, come to tell us what are you up to! Maybe we can help! Also, if you are doing something special and unique in the distribution area ('awesome'), be it for or within openSUSE or not - we'd love to hear about it.</p>

    <p>But don't worry if your talk doesn't seem to fit this theme, you can also teach people technologies that will help them bootstrap their projects. We always look forward to decent workshops in the area of distro building, packaging and such, and due to our co-location with LinuxDays, Gentoo and SUSE Labs, there is also plenty of room for hardcore hackingsessions and more beginner oriented workshops.</p>

    <p>If you want more details about the kind of sessions and what we expect from you as a speaker, visit our <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_speaker_guidelines">Speaker Guidelines</a> page.</p>

    <p>So if you're unsure if your idea fits our conference, let us decide that for you - just send it in!</p>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>Each conference will have their own Call for Papers. However, the CfP teams will collaborate to ensure there is no overlap and that sessions relevant for multiple audiences are planned in the right spot. It is therefor appreciated if you properly select if your proposal also has relevance for the other communities; and what level (beginner-intermediate-expert) it has; and what languages you'd prefer to give the session in.</p>

    <p>Also, if you're a Gentoo developer but have something also relevant for openSUSE - we'd be happy to have your proposal. If you're there to give a workshop to newbies about configuring their new Linux but can also talk about something much more technical - let us know.</p>
