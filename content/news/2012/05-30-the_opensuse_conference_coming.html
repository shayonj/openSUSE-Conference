<h1>The openSUSE Conference is coming!</h1>
We are happy to announce that after scouting many wonderful places, having long discussions and many last minute changes, we finally have an exact location and date set for the openSUSE Conference 2012 (oSC12) and our CfP committee is ready to accept talk proposals!

<h2>location and co-location</h2>
This year oSC12 will take place at the <a href="http://www.cvut.cz/en">Czech Technical University</a> in Prague. The campus is located in the district Dejvice and is next to an underground station that gets you directly to the historic city center. The conference will start at October 20 and end on the 23th.

<p>Like all openSUSE events, the Conference aims to bolster the 'open' in openSUSE, bringing together openSUSE 
contributors and members of numerous other Open Source projects. This years openSUSE Conference theme is <i>"Bootstrapping awesome!"</i>.
Why? Not just because of new new city and many new people on the organization part. But also because <em>we are not alone!</em>
This year, we will co-locate with no less than <strong>three other events</strong>: the local <a href="http://linuxdays.cz">LinuxDays</a>, the largest Czech Free Software event; the first <a href="http://miniconf.gentoo.org">Gentoo Miniconf</a>; and the 14th SUSE Labs conference. Having so many projects and people in one place will create a rich environment for fun and innovation, a place where ideas become reality and new friends are found!</p>
