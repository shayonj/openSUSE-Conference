<h1>Registration open since June 13st!</h1>
<p>The openSUSE Conference is an <strong>entirely free event</strong>. 
We highly encourage you to register as early as possible to ensure the best experience for you.If you register before the 14th of October, we promise:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To make sure you'll get a bag with goodies including a nice pluche geeko</li>
<li>To make sure we have food and drinks for you</li>
<li>To make sure we have room in the sessions for you!</li>
<!--<li>Last but not least, early bird registrations get some extra, cool benefits.</li>-->
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> We have a <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/Code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> 
for this conference and by attending you declare to be aware of and comply with it!</p>

<h2>Registration options</h2>
<p>While registration is free, there are two options to support our conference and get some extra perks. </p>
<ul>
<p>First of all, we have the <strong>Supporter Registration</strong> option for those who can spend $50 to support us. 
  You'll get a fun, exclusive gift for this - we won't tell you what it is yet!</p>

  <p>Due to lack of demand, the Professional level Registration has been withdrawn this year.   You are of course still allowed to pay for the professional registration and we'll give you a hug for that at the entrance, however, we won't be able to offer you the promised additional benefits.</p>
<div id="disabled">
<p>Then there is the <strong>Professional Registration</strong> option, for a cost of $350 or â‚¬250. With this ticket you support the openSUSE Conference and we'll give you something in return:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same exclusive gift as the Supporter Registration  </li>
<li>Access to a networking session/speaker dinner</li>
<li>Access to a feedback session with SUSE executive management team</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Registration for the openSUSE Conference has opened on June 13st and will not close - but if you register after the 14th of October we can't guarantee a badge, food or the bag with goodies and a pluche geeko!</p>
